## Function
In this application, a customer can place an order from the Variety Food Truck menu. The customer will be prompted to select menu items and the quantity desired. Once the order is finished, an order list and receipt will be printed for the customer. 

## Errors
The customer will be prompted with an error if the input is incorrect. They will be able to continue ordering after an error.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the BCS for providing the base code to this project and to Joe for his help! Also to my classmates for working together to solve these problems!
